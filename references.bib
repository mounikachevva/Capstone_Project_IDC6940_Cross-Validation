  abstract  = "The prediction of the martensite start temperature () for steels
               based on their chemical compositions is a complex problem.
               Previous work has developed empirical, thermodynamic, and
               machine learning models to estimate . However, the empirical
               models are limited to specific steel grades, the thermodynamic
               models rely on different model assumptions, and the machine
               learning models are based on a small number of data, are limited
               to specific steel grades, as well or are not available for easy
               use to the public. Herein, a new machine learning model for the
               prediction of is developed on the basis of two publicly
               available datasets consisting of 1800 steels from different
               steel grades. Extensive hyperparameter tuning is performed to
               find the best artificial neural network for the dataset. The
               best model improves prediction accuracy compared to previous
               state of the art. Despite a very good prediction accuracy of the
               model, unexpected behavior is observed in specific unseen data.
               This opens up the discussion for the requirements of new
               metrics. The dataset and the model are freely available at
               https://github.com/EAH‐Materials. An easy‐to‐use web tool to
               estimate without the need of programming based on the chemical
               composition can be found at
