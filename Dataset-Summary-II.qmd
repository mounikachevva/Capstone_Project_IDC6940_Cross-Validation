## Spotify Track Dataset

The **Spotify Tracks Dataset** contains information about various songs and their musical attributes, making it ideal for analyzing trends in music and predicting song popularity. It includes detailed metadata such as:

-   **Song Features**: Attributes like tempo, danceability, energy, loudness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, and valence that describe the characteristics of a track.

-   **Artist and Album Information**: Data about the song’s artist, album, and release date, which can help in analyzing trends across time or between artists.

-   **Popularity Score**: A key variable indicating the song's popularity, which is often used as the target for prediction models.

-   **Duration**: The length of the song in milliseconds, giving insights into song structure.

-   **Explicit Content**: Whether the song is marked as explicit, potentially offering insights into listener preferences.

Following columns have missing data:

-   **artists**: 1 missing value

-   **album_name**: 1 missing value

-   **track_name**: 1 missing value

## Martensite Start Temperature for Steels Dataset

This dataset contains the Martensite start temperature for various steel compositions, along with their corresponding chemical compositions. Martensite is a high-strength phase in steel, commonly referenced in materials science. For a relatable example, consider scenes in historical movies where blacksmiths submerge glowing swords into water during forging. This process transforms the steel into Martensite, making it exceptionally strong—critical in ancient warfare as Martensitic swords could shatter softer weapons. Today, Martensitic steel remains vital, especially in automotive safety, where it is used in car frames to protect passengers during collisions. The transformation temperature of steel into Martensite is influenced by its chemical composition, which typically includes elements like Carbon, Manganese, Silicon, and Aluminium. This dataset enables the development of models to predict Martensite start temperatures for different steel chemistries.

This dataset contains 1,543 entries and 16 columns, representing the chemical composition and martensite start temperature (Ms) for different steel samples. The key columns include various chemical elements such as Carbon (C), Manganese (Mn), Silicon (Si), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), and others, along with the Ms temperature for each sample. The dataset provides a comprehensive collection of steel compositions, making it useful for building predictive models to estimate the martensite start temperature based on the chemical composition of the steel.

Here’s a brief summary of the dataset:

-   **Chemical Elements**: Includes elements like C, Mn, Si, Cr, Ni, Mo, V, Co, Al, W, Cu, Nb, Ti, B, and N.

-   **Ms (Martensite Start Temperature)**: The target variable that indicates the temperature at which martensite starts forming in the steel.

This dataset can be used for modeling and prediction purposes, specifically to predict the martensite start temperature (Ms) based on the steel's chemical composition. It has no missing data.

## Car Dataset

There are nine columns and 301 entries in the car dataset. The following are the columns:

1. Car_Name: The car's name (in a category).
2. Year: Manufacture year (integer).
3. Selling Price: The amount being offered for the car (float).
4. Present_Price: The car's current retail price (float).
5. Kms_Driven: The automobile's total mileage (integer).
6. Fuel_Type: The kind of fuel the vehicle runs on (categorical: gasoline/diesel).
7. Seller_Type: The type of seller (dealer/individual, category).
8. Transmission: Transmission type (manual or automatic, respectively).
9. Owner: The integer number of prior owners.

The dataset is perfect for applications involving regression or classification because it contains both numerical and categorical data, with no missing values.

**Data Exploration** :
Exploration involves utilizing value_counts() to examine class distributions for categorical characteristics and reviewing summary statistics using describe() to comprehend data distributions. .corr() is used to analyze correlations between numerical information such as
Selling_Price and Present_Price. Histograms and scatter plots are a few examples of visualizations that can be used to find patterns, correlations, and outliers in data, which can aid with subsequent analysis and model creation.
